        <h2>About the Company</h2>
        <p>
            The ntegration of a Centralized Data Server System for Converged ICT Solutions aims to revolutionize how Converge ICT Solutions manages its operations by creating a centralized, 
            unified data processing system. Currently, multiple separate systems for customer management, billing, and network monitoring 
            make it challenging to access accurate information and respond swiftly to customer needs. By integrating all these functions into a single, 
            streamlined platform, the project will reduce redundant data by up to 50%, accelerate issue resolution, and enhance operational efficiency. 
            This transformation ensures more reliable service, faster responses, and a significant boost in customer satisfaction. 
            The project is designed to be delivered within a three-month timeline, leveraging open-source and cost-effective tools to maintain high quality 
            while remaining budget-conscious.

    <h2>Main Process Name (the system as a whole):</h2>
    <p>
        The diagram illustrates how the Centralized ICT Data Server Integration System 
        connects various departments and external entities. It receives data such as service 
        requests, configuration files, and user credentials, then processes and outputs 
        reports, alerts, and performance summaries. This integration streamlines data 
        sharing, enhances monitoring, and improves overall ICT operations efficiency.
